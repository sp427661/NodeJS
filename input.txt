Before creating an actual "Hello, World!" application using Node.js, let us see the components of a Node.js application. A Node.js application consists of the following three important components -

Import required modules - We use the require directive to load Node.js modules.

Create server - A server which will listen to client's requests similar to Apache HTTP Server.

Read request and return response - The server created in an earlier step will read the HTTP request made by the client which can be a browser or a console and return the response.
